# Organizations

Organizations are listed according to their headquarters, even if they operate
worldwide. The same organization may appear more than once if there is a
large enough branch on a different continent. The _Field/Focus_ It may contain
extra terms , but in general, the term "artificial intelligence" and "ethics"
will not be displayed since all mentioned here must work with both at some level.

# Other organizations
## Strategies to find A/IS ethics organizations
This area explain some strategies to find other A/IS Ethics organizations. But
keep in mind that:

* Some strategies will return several false positives.
  - Keep in mind that a different language (and even how websites are designed)
    can make it harder, so be ready to take more time
* Not all organizations are listed on wikipedia
  - ... and the ones that are, maybe not in exact language you are looking for
  - ... but Wikipedia can have several languages of the same page already interliked! ðŸ˜€
    - **See [FAQ:Wikipedia Interlanguage links](#wikipedia-interlanguage-links)**.
      Pages with Category of articles in one language can have different
      organizations on others. **Explicit warning: English does not have all organizations**.
* If you have the name in the original language of a organization (or the terms
  used by these groups of organizations), copy and paste these terms on some
  search engine. **Explicit warning: English will not necessary show more results on search engines**.
    - [ais-ethics-l10n](https://github.com/fititnt/ais-ethics-l10n) have a draft
      of some key terms that could help with search engines and social networks
      for organizations and groups.

or some of their extensions be also one A/IS Ethics organization.

- A good **starting** point is [Category:Computer science organizations on Wikipedia (English)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Computer_science_organizations).

# Extra informations

## Footnotes

- <b id="review-lang">review-lang</b>: This term requires review of a native
  speaker or a official source that confirms. See  [ais-ethics-orgs/issues/1](https://github.com/fititnt/ais-ethics-orgs/issues/1)
- <b id="l-gen">l-gen</b>: The link may be is more generic (like from a big
  area of government or a university) and not focused on the organization cited
  on this document.

## FAQ

### Why the _name-of-the-organization_ is listed on a specific region and not as "international"?

The adress used is headquarters of the organization. The same organization may
appear more than once if there is a _large_ enough branch on a different
continent. [Suggestions of missing extra branches are welcome!](#contributions).

### Wikipedia Interlanguage links
All links to wikipedia pages cited here very likely have links to versions of
the same content (that can not be just a translation, but have different content).
The Wikipedia help call they [Interlanguage links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Interlanguage_links).

#### Desktop access

If you access wikipedia with the desktop view, is less obvious the alternatives
in other languages.

- (Left-to-right languages), look at the bottom left, in the area with a term equivalent to "Languages"
- (Right-to-left languages) Look at the bottom right, in the area with a term equivalent to "Languages"

The next images use as example wikipedia page of [Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Artificial_Intelligence)
to switch to the persian page [Ø§Ù†Ø¬Ù…Ù† Ù¾ÛŒØ´Ø¨Ø±Ø¯ Ù‡ÙˆØ´ Ù…ØµÙ†ÙˆØ¹ÛŒ](https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%86_%D9%BE%DB%8C%D8%B4%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%AF_%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B4_%D9%85%D8%B5%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B9%DB%8C);
