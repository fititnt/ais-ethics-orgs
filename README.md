# Footnotes

- <b id="review-lang">review-lang</b>: This term requires review of a native
  speaker or a official source that confirms. See  [ais-ethics-orgs/issues/1](https://github.com/fititnt/ais-ethics-orgs/issues/1)
- <b id="l-gen">l-gen</b>: The link may be is more generic (like from a big

# FAQ

- **Why the _name-of-the-organization_ is listed on a specific region and not as "international"?**

The adress used is headquarters of the organization. The same organization may
appear more than once if there is a _large_ enough branch on a different
continent. [Suggestions of missing extra branches are welcome!](#contributions).

- **Can I do ... with this list?**

Yes, the [public domain](#license) license allow this, even without asking
first if you can do or not. If is a improvement to this main list, see
[Contributions](#contributions).
